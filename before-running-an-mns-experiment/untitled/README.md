# Getting Ready the Drones for an MNS Experiment

{% hint style="danger" %}
Drones are sophisticated and can be dangerous. Experimenting with more than one drone could cause serious injury and costs thousands of 'whatever currency you use'. So please be careful when using these or any other drones. Do not fly them in close proximity to people. Select a good location and bring someone with experience.
