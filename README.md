IRIDIA-Drone is a research drone specially designed for [Swarm Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics) experiments by researchers from the [IRIDIA](https://code.ulb.ac.be/lab/IRIDIA).  

The drone includes a custom-designed PCB, a Pixhawk 4 flight controller with the latest version of the PX4 flight stack, an Up Core Series onboard computer, a PX4Flow sensor, TFMini lidar module, and four down-looking LI-OV5640 USB cameras for performing flights with only local information.

The IRIDIA-Drone platform contains a pre-configured image for the Up Core board with the complete set of required software for working with peripheral devices and programming autonomous flights.

{% hint style="success" %}
 The design of the PCB and the source code of all software related to drones are open and available on GitHub.

**USER GUIDE** shows how to update your firmware and configure it with settings appropriate for your drone. This section also explains how to calibrate the main sensors \(compass, gyro/IMU, etc.\) and set up your remote control and safety features.
