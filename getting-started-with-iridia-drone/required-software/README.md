# Required Software

The IRIDIA-Drone control system is made up of three major software components:

* **PX4 Autopilot Firmware:**  PX4 firmware is the autopilot software responsible for processing the companion computer's input and controlling the drone. 
* **Companion Computer Software:** This is a complex autonomy software that flies the drone without human intervention.
* **QGroundControl Software:** QGroundControl is an open-source ground station software to install and configure the PX4 firmware onto the Pixhawk 4 flight controller board and calibrate the onboard sensors of the flight controller board.
* **MNS-Supervisor Software:** This is a very complicated asynchronous software to start and stop multi-robot experiments securely.
